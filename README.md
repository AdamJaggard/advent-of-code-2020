# Advent Of Code 2020 Solutions

These are my solutions to the daily problems from Advent Of Code 2020 (until christmas gets in the way!)

The solutions are all written in NodeJS, often only the second part of each days problems are kept (there are two parts to every daily problem with the second part being the more complex of the two)

You can find the problem descriptions for each day here: [https://adventofcode.com/2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)
